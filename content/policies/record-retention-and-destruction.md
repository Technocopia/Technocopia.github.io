##Record Retention and Destruction Policy##

The Board of Directors and staff of Technocopia, in order to ensure that necessary records and documents are adequately protected and maintained, and that records no longer needed or are of no value are discarded in the proper time shall adhere to the following Record Retention and Destruction Policy: 

A. Administration 
The Executive Director shall be responsible for the implementation of procedures to ensure that the Record Retention Schedule is followed. The Executive Director is authorized to make modifications to the Schedule from time to time to ensure that it is in compliance with local, state and federal laws. The modification must be requested in writing to the Board of Directors. 

B. Suspension of Record Disposal 
In the event that Technocopia is served with a subpoena or request for documents or any employee or Board Director becomes aware of a governmental investigation, audit or any litigation concerning Technocopia, the Executive Director and Board Chair shall be informed and any further disposal of documents shall be suspended until, with the advice of counsel, the Executive Director and Chair determine otherwise. 

C. Applicability 
This policy applies to all physical records generated in the course of Technocopia’s operation, including original documents, reproductions, and electronic documents. 

D. General Principle for Electronic Records 
Computer records should be backed-up no less than weekly. At least once a year an electronic back-up shall be made of essential Technocopia records including the donor and business database, financial records and structural documents with this backup to be secured off-site. Some documents may be retained in both paper and electronic form. 

E. General Principle for Maintaining Correspondence 
Documents that relate to routine matters should be discarded within two years. Those pertaining to non-routine matters or having significant lasting consequences should be generally retained. 

F. Security 
Records shall be retained in a secure place to prevent loss from theft or damage. Passwords to all files and accounts shall be documented in a file and shall be made available to appropriate staff. Passwords on financial accounts shall be changed quarterly. Upon termination of staff with account access, passwords should be updated. 

G. Public Records 
Central organizational documents such as the annual report and Form 990 will be made available by appointment at Technocopia’s office. Other documents may be obtained through written request to the Executive Director. A reasonable fee for copying and compiling data may be charged.
