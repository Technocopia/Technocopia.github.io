##Conflict of Interest Policy##

The purpose of this conflict-of-interest policy is to prevent the institutional or personal interests of Technocopia’s board members, officers, and staff from interfering with the performance of their duties to Technocopia and to ensure that there is no personal, professional, or political gain at the expense of Technocopia. This policy is not designed to eliminate relationships and activities that may create a duality of interest, but to require the disclosure of any conflicts of interest and the recusal of any interested party in a decision relating thereto.

A conflict of interest may exist when the interests or potential interests of any director, officer, or staff member, or that person’s close relative, or any individual, group, or organization to which the person associated with Technocopia has allegiance, may be seen as competing with the interests of Technocopia, or may impair such person’s independence or loyalty to Technocopia. A conflict of interest is defined as an interest that might affect, or might reasonably appear to affect, the judgment or conduct of any director, officer, or staff member in a manner that is adverse to the interests of Technocopia.

**Examples**

A conflict of interest may exist if a director, officer, staff member, or close relative
  1. Has a business or financial interest in any third party dealing with Technocopia.
  2. Derives remuneration or other financial gain from a transaction involving Technocopia (other than salary reported on a W-2 or W-9 or salary and benefits expressly authorized by the board).
  3. Receives gifts from any third party on the basis of his or her position with Technocopia (other than occasional gifts valued at no more than $[50], or if valued at more than $[50], the gift is made available in a team space or common area for others to share — e.g., fruit baskets, boxes of candy). All other gifts should be returned to the donor with the explanation that Technocopia policy does not permit the acceptance of gifts. No personal gift of money should ever be accepted.
  4. Engages in any outside employment or other activity that will materially encroach on such person’s obligations to Technocopia; compete with Technocopia activities; involve any use of Technocopia’s equipment, supplies, or facilities; or imply Technocopia’s sponsorship or support of the outside employment or activity.				 					 
**Use of Information**
	
Directors, officers, and staff shall not use information received from participation in Technocopia’s affairs, whether expressly denominated as confidential or not, for personal gain or to the detriment of Technocopia.

**Disclosure and Recusal**
  1. All board members and staff shall annually complete the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form and Related Party Questionnaire. This shall include direct services by a board or staff member, relative or by an entity in which they have an interest. By relative, Technocopia considers family relationships as defined by IRS to include spouse, ancestors, all descendants, siblings whether by whole or half blood, and the spouses of all descendants and siblings. This information shall be circulated in writing to all board members and updated annually. Information regarding staff shall be held by the Executive Director and made available to the Board for inspection.
  2. At the end of each year, all board members and staff doing business with the Organization shall disclose the full amount of money and/or value in services they (or the related party) have been paid by the agency.
  3. Disclosure shall also address potential issues raised if a Board member has or might acquire investments that may affect or be affected by the Organization’s investment decisions.
  4. Any decision coming before the Board of Directors or the Executive Director that involves doing business with a board member, staff person, relative or related entity shall require full disclosure of the financial interest in the matter. The minutes of the meeting of the board or its committee shall reflect that the conflict of interest was disclosed, that the interested person was not present during discussion or decision on the matter, and did not vote.
  5. Before the Organization enters into a business relationship with a board member, staff person, relative or related entity, a full discussion of all related information must be held by the Board or Executive Committee and a vote taken to insure that it is truly in the best interest of the Organization. The party in interest will abstain from said vote. When the business transaction between the Organization and the related party is considered substantial, the Board will decide if it is prudent to obtain an outside evaluation to insure that the proposal is feasible.
  6. All votes on related party transactions must receive a vote of two- thirds of the Board members present, excluding the party in interest, and there must be a quorum. The Organization must maintain full documentation of the process in which the decision was made for any related party transactions.
