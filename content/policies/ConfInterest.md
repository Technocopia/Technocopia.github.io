## Conflict of Interest Policy	
 
The purpose of this conflict-of-interest policy is to prevent the institutional or personal interests of Technocopia’s board members, officers, and staff from interfering with the performance of their duties to Technocopia and to ensure that there is no personal, professional, or political gain at the expense of Technocopia. This policy is not designed to eliminate relationships and activities that may create a duality of interest, but to require the disclosure of any conflicts of interest and the recusal of any interested party in a decision relating thereto.

A conflict of interest may exist when the interests or potential interests of any director, officer, or staff member, or that person’s close relative, or any individual, group, or organization to which the person associated with Technocopia has allegiance, may be seen as competing with the interests of Technocopia, or may impair such person’s independence or loyalty to Technocopia. A conflict of interest is defined as an interest that might affect, or might reasonably appear to affect, the judgment or conduct of any director, officer, or staff member in a manner that is adverse to the interests of Technocopia.

### Examples

A conflict of interest may exist if a director, officer, staff member, or close relative	

1. Has a business or financial interest in any third party dealing with Technocopia.	
2. Derives remuneration or other financial gain from a transaction involving Technocopia (other than salary reported on a W-2 or W-9 or salary and benefits expressly authorized by the board).	
3. Receives gifts from any third party on the basis of his or her position with Technocopia (other than occasional gifts valued at no more than $[50], or if valued at more than $[50], the gift is made available in a team space or common area for others to share — e.g., fruit baskets, boxes of candy). All other gifts should be returned to the donor with the explanation that Technocopia policy does not permit the acceptance of gifts. No personal gift of money should ever be accepted.	
4. Engages in any outside employment or other activity that will materially encroach on such person’s obligations to Technocopia; compete with Technocopia activities; involve any use of Technocopia’s equipment, supplies, or facilities; or imply Technocopia’s sponsorship or support of the outside employment or activity.	

### Use of Information
	
Directors, officers, and staff shall not use information received from participation in Technocopia’s affairs, whether expressly denominated as confidential or not, for personal gain or to the detriment of Technocopia.					

### Disclosure and Recusal

A. All board members and staff shall annually complete the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form and Related Party Questionnaire. This shall include direct services by a board or staff member, relative or by an entity in which they have an interest. By relative, Technocopia considers family relationships as defined by IRS to include spouse, ancestors, all descendants, siblings whether by whole or half blood,
