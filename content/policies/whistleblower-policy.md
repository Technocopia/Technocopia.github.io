##Reporting of Violation of Code of Ethics and Policies##
(Whistleblower Policy)

Technocopia is committed to lawful and ethical behavior in all of its activities and
requires its board members, committee members and staff to conduct themselves in a
manner that complies with all applicable laws and regulations. If at any time a person has
a concern regarding the propriety or legality of any other person, or believes that an
action needs to be taken for the organization to be in compliance with law or appropriate
ethical standards, the person should promptly advise the Board Chair.

If the management is unresponsive, if the complainant believes management will be
unresponsive, or if the Board Chair is the subject of the concern, the person should
contact any other member of the Executive Committee, Treasurer or Clerk.

While every effort will be made to investigate the report discreetly, because of the need
to investigate the report, correct the problem and prevent future problems, there is no
promise of confidentiality.

No person will be discharged, threatened or discriminated against in any manner for
reporting in good faith what he or she perceives to be wrongdoing, violations of law, or
unethical conduct. Â This Whistleblower Policy is intended to encourage and
enable employees and others to raise serious concerns within the organization prior to
seeking resolution outside the organization.

The Finance Committee of the board shall address all reported concerns or complaints
regarding corporate accounting practices, internal controls, or auditing. The Executive
Director or a Board Member shall immediately notify the Finance Committee of any such
complaint and work with the committee until the matter is resolved.

The Executive Director or Board Member will notify the sender and acknowledge receipt
of the reported violation or suspected violation within 10 business days. All reports will
be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by
the investigation.
