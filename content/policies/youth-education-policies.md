##Youth Education Policies##
(regarding students under the age of 18)

Our Mission
Technocopia is committed to providing you and your child with an engaging, interesting and effective program for enhancing student education while learning to work with peers in a nurturing and supervised environment. The lessons and experiments are designed to be informative, interesting, and led by skilled and experienced staff.

Our Staff
Technocopia works with experienced, talented teachers and we perform background checks on each individual upon joining us as staff. Our teachers strive to spark student curiosity about the world around us and instill an understanding and appreciation for learning. Fostering valuable skills of cooperation and collaboration with peers and instilling important safety habits are qualities we seek in all Technocopia staff.

Safety First
As part of our program, some classes will be using the usual laboratory materials and equipment such as glass pipettes and beakers, chemicals, hot plates, etc. Consequently, we take all reasonable precautions and instruct the students in proper handling and safety procedures. Obviously, we will have all the necessary safety materials and equipment, such as safety goggles, gloves, fire extinguishers, first aid kits, etc. on hand. Nevertheless, you and your student should understand that our classes are geared toward middle and high school level students, and all students will be expected to exhibit the maturity and discipline to handle these materials and to follow carefully all instructions and safety guidelines given to them. It must also be understood that in the event of an accident Technocopia cannot be held liable for any injuries that may be sustained to a student during this time.

Classroom Policies
Another important element of our program, and an essential requisite in a classroom environment, is respect both for equipment and for other individuals. Consequently, all students will be expected to handle all classroom equipment and materials in a responsible manner and treat all other students and staff with respect and consideration. To insure a nurturing, informative, safe experience for all children, there will be no tolerance for bullying, bickering, horseplay, or any other behavior which will detract from the positive experience of any other student, or which could cause an unsafe situation. Repeated or willful violations of the regulations will result in the loss of laboratory privileges and possible dismissal from the class. Should this occur, all payments will be forfeited. We count on you, as parents and guardians, to help us make every class a fun and memorable experience for your child by supporting us in this respect.

Fees and Deposits
Class fees and deposits for Technocopia programs can be found on our website under “Programs”. Deposits are necessary to reserve a student's spot in a program and full tuition is required for their continued involvement. Deposit amounts are equal to what is considered as the “trial period” of a class. This allows students to explore the first, second and/or third scheduled class before committing to its full duration. Trial periods are as follows:
	•	14 week class = First 3 classes 
	•	8 to 12 week workshop = First 2 classes 
	•	4 to 6 week workshop = First class 
Additionally, a $15 administrative fee is required annually per family. This fee is not required if enrollment is only for a one-time or per diem program.

Refunds
In the event that a class must be permanently canceled, your fees will be refunded or, if you prefer, applied to another program. Because we must make scheduling and financial commitments to our staff, any withdrawals made by a student or family from a program after its trial period will not result in a deposit refund. In addition, full tuition for that class will still be required.

Online Payments
After your initial deposit, Technocopia offers one time payment options and also bi-weekly or monthly installment plans. By agreeing to our terms and conditions you acknowledge that you are personally responsible for these charges to your credit card and will contact Technocopia to cancel or change payment agreements. Appropriate returns or refunds (please see above in Refunds) will be accommodated for when necessary.

Privacy
Technocopia does not share or sell any customer’s personal information with third parties.

Photo and Media
Technocopia will use audio and visual media in several of its classrooms. Audio and visual material; including written work, visual art, photos and videos created within Technocopia may be used on our website and other social media web pages. This includes media that may need to be uploaded to an external host before posting on Technocopia’s page. Please read through the different allowances on how your child can allow or refuse having their photo or video used for these purposes in the registration form found on our website.

Student Assessment
Upon request, Technocopia can provide proof documentation for programs your child has enrolled and fully participated in. This proof documentation will include: class descriptions, hours your child attended and full syllabuses. This is not a formal assessment and does not include a grade. A formal assessment of progress and/or reference letter can be requested but is at the independent discretion of each teacher. Cost per semester for such documentation is $18.

Copyright on Documents
Lesson plans, assignments, contracts or any other Technocopia document that is distributed physically, attached in an email or posted online, is copyrighted material that is not to be copied, re-distributed or altered in any way.

Transportation
Parents must recognize that when students are in transit to and from the Technocopia facility,  Technocopia is not liable. In addition, Technocopia teachers are not permitted to transport students to and from class or a field trip.

Field Trips
On occasion, Technocopia conducts classes away from the center. On such occasions, parents and guardians must provide their own transportation to and from the field trip location.

Thank You!
We look forward to you and your family joining our community and to partnering with you in your goal to provide your child with a sound, enlightened, well-rounded education.
