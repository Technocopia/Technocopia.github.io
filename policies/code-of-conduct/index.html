<p><strong>Breaking any of the following rules will result in loss of privileges, or ejection from space.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Do nothing that would require the creation of a new rule.  You will be held accountable for breaking “common sense” rules, even if they are not on the list.  When in doubt, ask.  </li>
  <li>Respect all people, equipment and space.</li>
  <li>Act, at all times, in a safe, polite and professional manner.</li>
  <li>Adhere to the following dress code:</li>
</ol>

<p>a. FOOTWEAR Steel toe boots are recommended. Soft soles and stable platforms provide the most secure footing. No high heels or open-toed shoes.
  b. CLOTHING Nothing on your person should hang away from the body. Long pants will protect you from debris and are highly recommended.
  c. JEWELRY Studs on the ears and face are fine. Bracelets, rings, necklaces, and watches should be avoided.
4. Personal protective equipment should be worn while near or using tools and machinery.
5. Clean up after yourself.  Always leave ample time to clean up.<br />
  a. Anything that is left out overnight will be considered donated for scrap.
6. Notify staff of any problem with the facility, machines, or other members ASAP.
7. Do not attempt maintenance or repair work on running equipment alone.  Contact the staff.
8. Do not use equipment you are not authorized to use, trained on, and comfortable using.
9. Do not operate power tools or machines alone.  Always have a buddy who can call for help.
10. Immediately obtain first aid for any injury and report to shop staff. When determining the severity of the injury, always err on the side of caution.
11. No minors are allowed in the space, unless approved by staff and being directly supervised by their guardian.
12. Do not leave power tools or machinery running unattended.
13. Take turns using machinery, be respectful to the needs of your fellows.
14. The lounge is for eating and drinking. Do not bring food or drinks into common work areas.
15. If you use the kitchen, clean up after yourself, and throw away or properly store all food.
16. Ensure that your workspace is properly lit and free of hazards, before working.
17. Work at your own pace.  Do not rush.
18. Pay attention to the machinery. If it does not feel or sound right is likely not working right.
19. Report any lost keys to the space, tools, or machinery immediately.
20. Keep floors clean.  Any spills should be cleaned in an appropriate manner immediately.
21. Store materials, and scrap. Do not pose a tripping hazard or put tools at risk for damage.
