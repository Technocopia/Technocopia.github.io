<h2 id="personnel-policies">Personnel Policies</h2>

<p>A. Definitions</p>

<p>Employees: All paid staff of Technocopia, including the Executive Director, whose means and methods of work are under the control and direction of the organization.</p>

<p>Full-time: An employee scheduled to work 40 hours a week.</p>

<p>Part-time: An employee regularly working less than 40 hours per week. A part-time employee working 20 hours or more per week may receive vacation, personal, health benefits, and sick days pro-rata.</p>

<p>Temporary: An employee hired to fill a temporary position for a specific limited period of time. Temporary employees receive no benefits except the benefits mandated by law during the period for which they are hired, unless negotiated at the time of hire. Temporary jobs may be extended by the Executive Director but may last no longer than one year. If a temporary job becomes an established position, it will be filled by the regular hiring procedure.</p>

<p>Independent Contractors: Technocopia may contract with individuals from time to time for various services for which they are paid fees, but not wages or benefits. Independent contractors are not covered by this policy manual unless explicitly stated and said independent contractor’s status shall be determined based on relevant federal and state laws.</p>

<p>B. Staff Benefits  </p>

<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the following Staff Benefits Section, all policies, rules and regulations shall be subject at all times to Federal, State and local laws, specifically including FMLA, MMLA and all relevant Wage Laws.</p>

<p>i. Holidays  </p>

<p>To accommodate both the staffing needs of the Technocopia and the traditions of employees, in lieu of traditional holidays staff are allowed 10 paid days off each year unassigned to specific dates. Staff will consult with the Executive Director on the scheduling of these dates. These holidays are not a substitute for vacation and staff are encouraged to stagger these days off throughout the year. Holidays do not carry over into the next fiscal year.</p>

<p>ii. Vacations  </p>

<p>Full-time staff members accrue 1.25 vacation days per month, for a total of 15 days of vacation leave annually. Only one week of one year’s vacation time may be carried over to the next fiscal year starting July 1. At no time may an employee take more than three consecutive weeks paid vacation. When an employee leaves Technocopia, payment in lieu of vacation may be made of up to one year’s vacation entitlement.</p>

<p>iii. Personal and Sick Days  </p>

<p>Full-time staff members may take 10 personal days per year with pay. Unused personal days cannot be carried over into the next calendar year. Emergency sick or bereavement leave up to two weeks may be granted by the Board of Directors. Employees shall furnish written verification upon request of the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>iv. Leave of Absence</p>

<p>A leave of absence with or without pay may be granted by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>v. Parental Leave  </p>

<p>Parental Leave is available to full-time employees with at least one year of service, to a maximum of three months’ leave, with two paid weeks and up to 10 unpaid weeks off for childbirth and adoption, or the placement of a child in foster care. This leave must be taken within one year of the birth, adoption or placement in foster care.</p>

<p>In the event that both parents of the child work for Technocopia, the parties shall work with the parents to facilitate a policy that gives each parent the maximum allowable benefit during the first year but at no times shall such leave overlap for more than two weeks. Said policy shall always be subject to and subordinate to all applicable laws (specifically including State and Federal laws) and always with the goal of minimizing negative operational impact to Technocopia.</p>

<p>Vacation and sick leave and personal days can be used during the unpaid portion of a parental leave. In addition, staff will continue to receive medical insurance for up to 12 weeks of leave, if already enrolled it before the leave.</p>

<p>At the end of your leave, staff may return to their previous position or another comparable position with the same rate of pay.</p>

<p>vi. Health Insurance  </p>

<p>Technocopia provides health insurance premiums for employees and their families under a health plan approved by the Board of Directors, pro-rated for part-time employees. Technocopia reserves the right to amend this policy and the level of health coverage as appropriate during its annual budgetary review and/or as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate.</p>

<p>vii. Job Related Training  </p>

<p>Full-time employees may be compensated in whole or in part for job related training including Technocopia classes and off-site programs such as computer or management workshops. These expenses are reflected in Technocopia operating budget and must be approved prior to enrollment by the Executive Director. Expenses may exceed the budgeted amount only with prior approval of the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>viii. Use of Technocopia Facilities and Equipment  </p>

<p>To encourage skill building and community engagement, at the discretion of the Executive Director, staff may also receive free or discounted membership, studio space, and Technocopia classes. These benefits shall be established by written approval of the Executive Director (or Board of Directors in the case of the ED) and recorded as part of staff compensation.</p>

<p>All commercial activity on Technocopia premises by staff must be disclosed to the Board of Directors. Staff using Technocopia space and/or equipment for any business purpose may be required to pay standard rates.</p>

<p>ix. Jury Duty</p>

<p>Full-time staff called to jury duty shall be paid for a maximum of three days. If jury duty obligations last longer than the equivalent of three days, the remainder of the leave is unpaid or offset against personal or vacation time, at the discretion of the employee. Staff shall give prior notice of the jury duty call to the Executive Director and present evidence of service from the court. </p>

<p>ix. Other Benefits  </p>

<p>Technocopia assumes the costs for Workers Compensation under the provisions of the Mass. Workmen’s Compensation Plan. In addition, Technocopia contributes to F.I.C.A. and covers employees’ federal and state unemployment insurance.</p>

<p>C. Travel/Reimbursements  </p>

<p>Staff members may be reimbursed for travel and other expenses incurred in the course of Technocopia business outside of Somerville. Automobile travel reimbursement will be made at a rate set annually by the Board of Directors. Claims for reimbursement must be presented with receipts. All requests for travel and expense reimbursement must be presented within 30 days of the expenditure.</p>

<p>D. Hiring Authority, Documentation, Compensation and Performance Review  </p>

<p>Executive Director:</p>

<p>The Executive Director is hired and reports to the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>The Board shall establish and maintain reasonable and competitive compensation consistent with comparable non-profit organizations in the Worcester area. A competent salary survey shall be used to benchmark compensation for the position and the Board shall consider the market-based compensation practices for individuals possessing the experience and skills needed to improve the overall performance of the organization. Annual salary review shall include a merit determination, as well as considerations for
length of service, and budgetary constraints.</p>

<p>The Executive or other designated Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the review of the Executive Director. The Committee of the Board of Directors shall once a year review the performance of the Executive Director relative to the job description and annual goals and objectives, recommend compensation levels and set forward goals and objectives for the coming year. The Committee shall meet independent of the Executive Director and during these deliberations shall also consider input obtained from other board members, staff, professional advisors and other informed community leaders. The Committee presents its findings and recommendations, in an executive session
without the Executive Director present, to the full board for review and approval. The Committee and/or Board Chair shall meet with the Executive Director to discuss and document performance, goals for the upcoming year and compensation. Documentation of the review and compensation shall be maintained in the Executive Director’s Personnel File.</p>

<p>Staff:</p>

<p>The Executive Director is responsible for the hiring all other staff and consultants.</p>

<p>Salary levels of all staff members are reviewed once a year and compensation is approved by the Board of Directors as part of the annual budget process. The Executive Director has discretion to determine compensation of staff within the limits set forward in the annual budget.</p>

<p>The Executive Director shall review performance and set goals and objectives for all staff
and consultants. All staff shall be reviewed for performance at least once a year. For
new employees there shall be interim performance review at 3 months of employment.</p>

<p>All reviews and other staff evaluations must be documented. They shall be signed by the employee and supervisor to acknowledge that they have seen the report and all related documents shall be maintained in an appropriate Personnel File.</p>

<p>Documentation:</p>

<p>All new employees will be asked to submit the following documentation:</p>

<pre><code>•	Resume 
•	W-2 tax form 
•	Federal employment eligibility form I-9 
•	Employment application including emergency contact information 
•	Other documents as required by law 
</code></pre>

<p>E. Work Hours</p>

<p>Staff self-manage their work hours. There is no provision for overtime pay for salaried staff.</p>

<p>Pay periods are weekly. Weekly time sheets shall be filled out by each employee. The Executive Director shall maintain a summary record detailing hours worked, vacation, holiday and other benefits.</p>

<p>F. Record Keeping – Personnel Files and Timesheets</p>

<p>A personnel file shall be maintained for each employee. The Executive Director and/or Board Liaison shall be the custodian of the file. Any employee can have access to copies of material in his or her own file. Upon termination/resignation an employee may receive copies of material from his or her file. The original material will remain property of Technocopia.</p>

<p>G. Electronic Mail and Internet Access</p>

<p>Technocopia provides e-mail service and Internet access as tools to the staff necessary to do their jobs. All non-personal e-mail/Internet records are considered company records. Although Technocopia management does not intend to regularly review these records, staff should not consider them private. Staff should treat electronic files as they would share paper files, with the expectation that anything in them is available for review.</p>

<p>H. Conflict of Interest and Related Parties</p>

<p>To prevent the institutional or personal interests of staff from interfering with the performance of their duties to Technocopia and to ensure that there is no personal, professional, or political gain at the expense of Technocopia, all staff are required to comply with the organization’s Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy is not designed to eliminate relationships and activities that may create a duality of interest, but to require the disclosure of any conflicts of interest and the recusal of any interested party in a decision relating thereto.</p>

<p>All staff and members of the Board of Directors are required to annually complete the Conflict of Interest and Related Party Questionnaire.</p>

<p>I. End of Service</p>

<p>Employment at Technocopia is at will. “At will” means employment may be terminated at any time, with or without cause or advance notice as long as the termination is not in violation of federal or state laws.</p>

<p>Each employee, upon termination or resignation, shall engage in an exit interview. At the time of this interview, the staff person is required to return all Technocopia property presently in his/her possession, including, but not limited to keys, credit cards, files, tools, etc.</p>

<p>i Resignation</p>

<p>For the Executive Director, notice of intent to resign employment must be given 30 days in advance of termination date. All other employees’ resignations must be given 14 days in advance in writing. Failure to do the above will result in benefits being forfeited upon termination.</p>

<p>Staff will receive final pay in accordance with applicable state law as well as other accrued, vested benefits as outlined in these policies.</p>

<p>ii. Poor Performance</p>

<p>If the Executive Director finds that regular training and coaching are not effective in assisting the staff person in fulfilling the requirements of the job, the Executive Director may issue a written warning with specification on areas needing improvement. Failure to meet goals outlined in warnings is grounds for termination.</p>

<p>In cases of unsatisfactory performance by the ED, the Board of Directors will take corrective action.</p>

<p>iii. Misconduct</p>

<p>Misconduct includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<pre><code>•	Refusal to observe the policies and procedures of Technocopia. 
•	Unauthorized use of Technocopia funds or property. 
•	Unauthorized release of confidential information. 
•	Intentional contradiction of a management decision or reasonable instructions of a supervisor. 
•	Acts of discrimination or harassment, including unwanted sexual behavior in acts or words, which results in reducing co-workers' ability to perform their jobs. 
</code></pre>

<p>In cases of misconduct, the Executive Director has the discretion to suspend the employee with or without pay while investigating facts related to the act of misconduct. Based on the results of the investigation of misconduct, the Executive Director may decide to:</p>

<pre><code>1.	terminate the employee, 
2.	issue a warning, or 
3.	if the investigation concludes there was no misconduct, reinstate the 
employee to previous status.
</code></pre>

<p>J. Grievance Procedures  </p>

<p>All grievances of employees against a Board or staff member or other member of Technocopia community should be first discussed with the Board President or Executive Director.</p>

<p>Should the grievance persist, the employee should document the grievance in writing and submit a request for a hearing to the Board of Directors. The Board will select a Board member or other representative to assist in resolving the dispute. Should the grievance persist, the employee may appeal in writing to the Board of Directors as a whole. Within 30 days of receiving the grievance document the Executive Committee shall render a decision on the merits of the grievance and any remedies. Decisions of the entire Board of Directors are final.</p>
