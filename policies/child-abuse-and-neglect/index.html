<h2 id="child-abuse-and-neglect-policy">Child Abuse and Neglect Policy</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>	
    <ul>
      <li>To inform all members and staff of Technocopia of the requirement to report suspected child abuse (including sexual abuse) or neglect and to inform staff of their immunity from civil liability or criminal penalty for reporting.</li>
      <li>To establish procedures to be used by all staff of Technocopia in making oral and written reports to the appropriate authorities of suspected cases of child abuse or neglect.	 </li>
      <li>To protect children from abuse and neglect. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Definitions</strong> - Under this Policy, the abuse and neglect of a child (i.e., any individual under the age of eighteen (18) years) is defined as follows:	
    <ul>
      <li>Physical  injury not necessarily visible of a child under circumstances that indicate that a child’s health or welfare is harmed or at substantial risk of being harmed</li>
      <li>The observable, identifiable, and substantial impairment of a child’s mental or psychological ability to function</li>
      <li>The failure to provide proper care and attention to a child, including leaving a child unattended, under circumstances that indicate that the child’s health or welfare is harmed or placed at  substantial risk of harm</li>
      <li>Any act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a child (i.e., any sexual contact or conduct with a child) regardless of whether the child has physical injuries </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Who Must Report</strong> - Any member or staff of Technocopia who has reason to believe that a child has been subjected to abuse (including sexual abuse) or neglect (the “Reporter”) caused by any parent, guardian, adoptive parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of such child (including Technocopia staff), or any household or family member of such child, shall make a report as directed below. A Technocopia member or staff person must act on the basis of any information and belief. The law gives the Reporter very little latitude.</li>
  <li>The Reporter must immediately notify and give all information required below to Technocopia’s Executive Director, or the next available administrative staff. If an administrative staff is not immediately available, the Reporter must proceed to step 2.</li>
  <li>After notifying the Head or Designee, the Reporter, along with the notified staff, must make 	an oral report (by telephone or direct communication) as soon as possible to the local law enforcement agency. Contact information is as follows:
    Worcester Police Department
    9 – 11 Lincoln Sq.
    Worcester, MA 01608
    Ph: 508 799 8600	</li>
  <li>
    <p>The Reporter must also make a written report to the local Department of 	Children and Families not later than forty-eight (48) hours after 	the contact, examination, attention, or treatment that caused the Reporter to believe that the child had been subjected to abuse (including sexual abuse) or neglect. The written report must be signed either (i) by the Reporter or (ii) by the Reporter and the consulting administrative staff. Contact information is as follows: 
    DCF Worcester East Area Office
    151 West Boylston Drive
    Worcester, MA 01606
    (508) 793 8000
    Fax (508) 754 9803
    Child-At-Risk Hotline: 1 800 792 5200</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Contents of Written Report</strong> - As far as is reasonably possible, an oral or written report made under this Policy shall include the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>the name, age, and home address of the child </li>
      <li>the name and home address of the child’s parent or other person responsible for the child’s care	 </li>
      <li>the whereabouts of the child	 </li>
      <li>the nature and extent of the abuse or neglect of the child, including any evidence or information available to the Reporter concerning possible previous instances of abuse or neglect </li>
      <li>any other information that would help to determine (i) the cause of the suspected abuse or neglect; and (ii) the identity of any individual responsible for the abuse or neglect </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Further information on such reporting can be found at:
http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dcf/child-abuse-neglect/reporting-abuse.html</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Immunity</strong> - Any person who in good faith makes or participates in making a report of abuse or neglect or participates in an investigation or a resulting judicial proceeding is immune by state law from any civil liability or criminal penalty that would otherwise result from making or participating in a report of abuse or neglect or participating in an investigation or a resulting judicial proceeding.</li>
